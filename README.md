# CERN Experiment Database

## Description
To create an API for a CERN experiment database – designed to allow users connected with CERN to login into a system with upload and download experiment data functionality with constrictions on access based on user privilege; the learning outcome from the project was to demonstrate Secure Software Development (SSD) based on the OWASP top ten security vulnerabilities. 
## 1. Implementation
The CERN experiment database API was programmed in Python3, utilizing Python SQLite3 module to interact with SQLite databases and with Flask providing the framework to connected each module. Code written in IDE's Visual code studio and PyCharm.
## 2. Architecture 
We have used Flask to build a web application microservice. 
## 3. Features
### User funtionality
* User menu (command line input)
* Sign up/login
* Upload/download (experiment data)
### Security Features
Selected to demostrate SSD and based on the OWASP top ten security vulnerabilities this project incoporates the following security features.
* Authentication
* Hashing  
* Data encryption
* Parametrised Queries
* Authorisation
## 4. Installation
### Dependencies 
The programme requirements :
* Python 3.10
* Flask 2.2.2 
### How to run
Description of how to run the file
## 5. Structure
